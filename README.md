# Visualization-Toolkit-VTK-Learning
This project provides theoretical explanations, environment installation, and code walkthroughs for the latest version of the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). We hope to learn and exchange ideas together with everyone.

The reference materials are primarily based on the official book and examples. The accompanying textual materials for the project explanations are provided in the document titled "Visualization Toolkit (VTK)开发.doc," which will be updated periodically. The code is organized into different folders for each explanation example. For video tutorials, please follow my Bilibili account.
